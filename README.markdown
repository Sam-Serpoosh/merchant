#Merchant

This is another one of my programming for fun and  deliberate practicing series :-) 

I wrote the [Merchant](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/merchant.html) rails app from [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com/)

As usual I did a lot of **Refactoring** on the code and design. Wrote bunch of **Automated Unit Tests** for it! Extracted non-rails part of the application for having better separation of concerns having and fast-isolated-unit-tests for them! (If any exists of course)

*Like always feedbacks are more than welcome.*
